## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## Optimizations

After building the API and creating local JSON data to prove out my MVP, the data now is hosted in a MongoDB collection.
This meant that I had to refactor my code to work with the database as well as implement CRUD functionality.

## Lessons Learned:

- Build an API using Node.js and Express.js
- Using Javascript to capture Form Input
- Implement logic to capture request and send a response
- Communicate between the backend, database and the front end

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
